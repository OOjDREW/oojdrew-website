	    <B>1. Type Definition</B><BR/>
	    If your knowledge base makes use of the type system, you must define the type hierarchy
	    for it. This is done in RDFS, using the rdfs:Class and rdfs:subClassOf elements. This
	    RDFS document can be entered in the text area provided on the <I>Type Definition</I>
	    tab.  

	    <BR />Note that the following types are predefined:<BR/>
	    <UL>
		<LI>Thing - The top of the type lattice - every type will inherit from this type</LI>
		<LI>String - A type to represent strings - this is used by the built-in relations</LI>
		<LI>Numeric - A base type for numeric values</LI>
		<LI>Integer - A type to represent integer numbers - this is a sub-type of Numeric. This is used by the built-in relations</LI>
		<LI>Real - A type to represent real numbers - this is a sub-type of Numeric. This is used by the built-in relations</LI>
		<LI>Nothing - The bottom of the type lattice - this type inherits from every type. This is used as the artificial lower bound when two types have now lower bound. You cannot create a type that is a sub-type of Nothing.</LI>
   	    </UL>
	    Once you have entered the rdfs to define your types press the <I>Load Type Information</I> button
	    to parse the type information.<BR />
	    If your knowledge base does not make use of types you do not need to do anything on the <I>Type Definition</I> tab.
	</P>
	<P>
	    <B>2. Knowledge Base</B><BR/>
	    The knowledge base (rulebase) can be entered in either RuleML 0.88 (with rest tags) XML format,
	    or the POSL syntax. At the <I>Knowledge Base</I> tab of the application window
	    select the correct format with the radio buttons at the bottom of the tab,
	    and then enter the knowledge base in the text area provided on the <I>Knowledge
	    Base</I> tab, you should be able to copy and paste from other applications.<BR />
	    Once you have entered your knowledge base click the <I>Parse Knowledge Base</I> button to parse and load your knowledge base. When you parse a knowledge base
	    all previous known clauses are erased.
	</P>
	<P>
	    If you knowledge base makes use of the type system you should complete step one before doing this step.
	</P>
	<P>
	    <B>3. Running the Forward Reasoner</B>
	    To run the forward reasoner click on the <I>Run Forward Reasoner</I> button on the <I>Output</I> tab, all 
 	    facts and rules that can be produced from the input knowledge base are
	    output in the text area on the <I>Output</I> tab, in the format of the format selected at the
	    bottom of the application window (this can be changed inbetween parsing the knowledge base and running the reasoner).
